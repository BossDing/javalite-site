This page describes functionality and usage of a tiny testing library called JSpec.
JSpec was originated from ActiveJDBC project and was inspired by RSpec from the Ruby world.

<h2> The idea </h2>

The main idea is to replace "assert" language with "should" language and make it as close to English as possible. This forces the brain to work in a different mode, writing a "specification of behavior" for your program rather than "assertion" that  the program works. The difference might seem subtle, but requires a different style of thinking and promotes true TDD/BDD - when specifications are written before implementation, sometimes even by different people.

JSpec uses 'should' word instead of 'assert'. Here is an example of an old style test:

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
@Test
public void testCalculator(){
   Calculator c = new Calculator();
   c.add(2, 2);
   assertEquals(c.result(), 4);
}
</pre>


The JSpec style of writing this test would be:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
@Test
public void shouldAddNumbersCorrectly(){
   Calculator c = new Calculator();
   c.add(2, 2);
   a(c.result()).shouldBeEqual(4);
}
</pre>

The result of executing either test is the same, but the style is completely different:
  * The method name starts with "should", which implies that the functionality is not developed yet! It is very important to write tests with clear understanding of the requirements and describe a system "behavior" in code before implementation is even developed.
  * The expectation reads like an English sentence: "calculation result should be equal 4".

<h2>The 'the', 'a' and 'it'</h2>

In the code above, you see the usage of 'a()' method. This method returns an object "Expectation", which you really do not care about, because it is never used directly, but rather used as a form of a [http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html fluent interface] that has all the should* methods for verification of expectations.

<h3>The 'a' and 'the'</h3>

All the three methods 'the', 'a' and 'it' return the expectation object.  The 'a' and the 'the' methods are identical. One is a synonym of another. The reason for two methods doing the same is to provide both English words to make the expectation "sentence" sound better. Sometimes the 'a' sounds better, sometimes the 'the'.

<h4>Numeric type indifference in 'a' and 'the'</h4>

Additionally, there is an interesting feature of the 'a' and 'the' methods: they are numeric type agnostic. In JUnit this will fail:

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
assertEqual(3, 3L); // will fail
</pre>
while the two numbers are identical in value for all practical purposes, the JUnit assertion will fail just because the types are different, one being an Integer, and another a Long.
The same test in JSpec using either 'a' or 'the' will succeed:
    <pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
a(3).shouldBeEqual(3L); // will succeed
</pre>


<h3>The 'it'</h3>

The only difference between the 'it' method and 'a' or 'the' is that in the 'it' method the tested object type and expected object type are parametrized with Java Generics. This means that they must be the same type:

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
it(3).shouldBeEqual(3L);// will not compile
</pre>

    <h2>Expectation methods</h2>

<h3>shouldEqual, shouldBeEqual and shouldNotBeEqual</h3>
Expect that  the two objects are equal with the use of a standard <code>java.lang.Object.equals()</code> method:

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
a(obj1).shouldEqual(obj2);
</pre>

The great thing about this method is that it will check  that the objects are the same type, has a protection for <code>null</code> and will produce a good quality message in case objects are not equal. This code:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
String a = "a", b = "b";
a(a).shouldBeEqual(b);
</pre>
Will produce this message:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
Test object:
java.lang.String == &lt;a&gt;
and expected
java.lang.String == &lt;b&gt;
</pre>

while this code:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
String a = "a", b = null;
a(a).shouldBeEqual(b);
</pre>

will produce this message:

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
Test object:
java.lang.String == &lt;a&gt;
and expected
null == &lt;null&gt;
</pre>

As you can see, the messages not only provide values of tested and expected objects, but also provide their types, which is often important.


<h3>shouldHave, shouldBe, shouldNotBe </h3>
There are three dynamic boolean methods that are supported by JSpec:
  * shouldHave(String)
  * shouldBe(String)
  * shouldNotBe(String)

For all three methods, the argument is an abridged boolean method of a tested class. This means that if there is such a class Person:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
class Person{
  private String name;
  ... setter/getter
  public boolean isValid(return name != null; )
}
</pre>
you can write an expectation in this style:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
Person person = new Person();
a(person).shouldBe("valid");
</pre>

What happens here is that the JSpec will dynamically execute the method <code>person.isValid()</code> and will evaluate its return value. If the value returned is false, the expectation is not met, and test will fail with exception.

Example for shouldHave:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
class Validation{
  public boolean hasErrors(){...};
}
</pre>
and the expectation is:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
Validation validation = new Validation();
a(validation).shouldHave("errors");
</pre>

The goal of this style of expectations to make them as close as possible to sound like an English sentence.

<h3>shouldBeNull and shouldNotBeNull</h3>
Expects that the tested reference is not null (or is):

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
a(x).shouldNotBeNull();
</pre>

In case the x is actually <code>null</code>, the test will fail with:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
javalite.test.jspec.TestException: Object is null, while it is not expected
</pre>


<h3>shouldBeType and shouldBeA</h3>

Sets up expectation for a tested object's type:

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
a(a).shouldBeType(Long.class);
</pre>

If expectation not met, the error can be:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
javalite.test.jspec.TestException: class java.lang.String is not class java.lang.Long
</pre>

<code>shouldBeA</code> is a synonym of <code>shouldBeType</code>, use either one for a better sounding sentence.


<h3>shouldBeFalse and shouldBeTrue</h3>

These are self-explanatory:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
a( 2 * 2 == 4).shouldBeTrue();
</pre>
and:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
a( 2 * 2 == 5).shouldBeFalse();
</pre>



<h3>shouldBeTheSameAs  and shouldNotBeTheSameAs</h3>

These methods are to check if the tested and expected references point to the same (or not) object.

<h3>shouldContain/shouldNotContain</h3>

Tests that an expected value is contained in the tested object. The tested object can be of the following types:

        <ul>
            <li>Any object - in this case, the string representation of this object is tested to contain a string representation of expected value as a substring. For example, this will pass:</li>
        </ul>

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
  the("meaning of life is 42").shouldContain("meaning");
</pre>
        <ul>
            <li><code>java.util.List</code> - in this case, the tested list is expected to contain an expected object. For example, this will pass:</li>
        </ul>

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
  a(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3)).shouldContain(3);
</pre>
        <ul>
            <li><code>java.util.Map</code> - in this case, the tested map is expected to contain an object whose key is the expected object. For example, this will pass:</li>
        </ul>

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
  Map map = new HashMap();
  map.put("one", 1);
  map.put("two", 2);
  map.put("three", 3);
  a(map).shouldContain("two");
</pre>


The method <code>shouldNotContain()</code> is exactly the opposite of shouldContain().


<h3>Expecting difference</h3>

Often times you need to ensure that some number before and after the operation is different. For instance, this could be a total count of specific records in a table, or a size of a list.
Here is an example of using a difference expectation with JSpec:

<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
expect(new DifferenceExpectation(Person.find("last_name like ?", "Smith").size()) {
  public Object exec() {
     Person.updateAll("last_name = ?", "Smith");
     return Person.find("last_name like ?", "Smith").size();
  }
});
</pre>

In the code snippet above, the constructor of <code>DifferenceExpectation(..)</code> is passed an initial value, and the method <code>exec()</code> returns a final value. The initial and final are compared to be different at the end of a test. If they are the same, then the test fails.
An example message:
<pre name="code" class="brush:java;">
javalite.test.jspec.TestException: Objects: '1' and '1' are equal, but they should not be
</pre>
